= Ansible playbook for turning a PC into a set of supply VMs

[NOTE] 
====
Under construction. Sections marked with !!! and ??? are notes to self. 
Like this one.

!!! 
Write one command to kick off the build of everything.

Use one certificate CA, not three.

Ansible helps me assemble my home lab. 
I used three PCs to build a reasonably complicated network.
Each PC has a purpose.
One PC acts as an application builder and manager. It manages the building of things.  Another PC provides sources of data for this builder, and one is supplied by the builder.

* *source* PC is a home for applications that provide data sources to Red Hat software, such as third party data vaults, user directories and code stores.
* *build* PC holds Red Hat software, such as AAP, IdM and Satellite.
* *supply* PC is where things are collected, such as logs, metrics, and mail. It is also where build applications create customer services.  
This playbook turns a PC running RHEL 9 into a hypervisor running a pile-load (that's the technical term) of Virtual Machines. 


== built by Ansible

Each machine has its own Ansible playbook.
These create a network of virtual machines on three fresh RHEL 9 hosts.

* https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-source
* https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-build
* https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-supply

Two supporting collections so far. 

* https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-collection-platform
* https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-collection-app


== hardware

This PC is a small Asus PN50, but anything with these specs would do.

* 64GB RAM 
* 1TB storage
* 4 core CPU

It's a lot of memory, and yet it isn't enough. 
It's never enough. 


== OS (Operating System)

I use the playbook on this OS. 

RHEL 9, fresh minimal install


== the KVM/QEMU hypervisor 

A bootstrap shell script kicks off the install. 
See instructions in 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-supply/blob/main/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap.sh].



== VMs (Virtual Machines)

image::supply-network.drawio.png[title="supply network"] 

The https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-supply/blob/main/group_vars/all/main.yml[defaults file] defines a lot of values. 
For instance, most 
MAC addresses are set to ** 52:54:00:15:00:* **,  and 
IPv4 addresses are set to ** 192.168.15.* **.

== applications

Each VM runs a set of services that support my home lab. 

. *gateway* hosts Bind, Squid, Postfix, NFS, haproxy, cockpit
. *idreplica* replica for Red Hat IDM (LDAP, CA, DNS)
. *capsule* proxy for Red Hat Satellite
. *aapee* Ansible Automation Platform Execution Environment node
. *message* Postfix
. *monitor* 
. *customer* 


== cheat sheet


=== PC and OS

Start with a machine running RHEL 9. 
A fresh minimal install is fine. 

Only tested on a box with one ethernet interface, plugged into the network.


=== edit the bootstrap script

Script 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-supply/blob/main/bootstrap.sh[bootstrap.sh] 
sets up everything on a freshly installed host. 

* Log into the hypervisor machine.
* Download the script.

[source,shell]
....
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-source/main/bootstrap.sh
....

* Read the script 
* Follow the instructions and edit the script.
